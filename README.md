# PG-CEP
Generating station costing and design for load profiles of 6 different countries. Prepared as a Complex Engineering Problem (CEP)-based end-of-semester project for EE-411 Power Generation (Fall 2023) as part of BE-Electrical Engineering at NEDUET.

## Project Report

## Deliverables
MATLAB GUI Application

![My Image](Picture1.jpg)

A GUI application for the technical and economic analysis of 6 real-world load profiles. Built with MATLAB App Designer R2020a.
Loads and plots data for 6 real-world daily load profiles (one at a time).

Allows user to calculate:-

Technical Metrics: load factor, maximum load, base load, average load, units consumed.

Economic Metrics: Overall cost per unit generated (two-part or three-part).

Designed in SketchUp.


**Proposed designs are:**
1. Nuclear Power Station Design
2. Diesel Power Station Design

**Designs account for:**

-Generator dimensions and spacing requirements.

-Transmission yard and relevant equipment.

-Fuel transportation and storage requirements.

-Heat rejection and exhaust systems.
